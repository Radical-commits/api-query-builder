# Infobip API Configuration (Optional)
# These values can be set as defaults, but users can override them in the UI

# VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.infobip.com
# VITE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

# Note: In Vite, environment variables must be prefixed with VITE_ to be exposed to the client
# For security, it's recommended to NOT store API keys in environment files
# Instead, users should enter them directly in the application UI
